          info: "Data exploration should identify:
                 - distribution of the data (can help to map unidentified skip patterns or error from data download or studies) (e.g. write the NA%)
                 - Issues with how to properly address harmonized different variable types (e.g. decisions linked changing categorical into binary)
                 - keywords used to try to identify the variables and indication of whether they were searched
                 - different variables and arguments for their use
                 Comments about the harmo rule may include:

                 the exploration must reflect the process of thinking of the harmonizer. They must explain reasons to:
                 complete: explain reasons why you exclude other candidates, and why you kept the final variables
                 impossible: explain reasons why you exclude all potential (data quality, no fit with definition...) or the fact that you found nothing (explicit keywords)
                 undetermined: explain reasons why you hesitate between candidates and (potentially) next steps (contact project manager, contact PI, further investigation)

                 The validator will need all thinking process of the harmonizer to decide if they:
                 agree: no explanation needed if exploration explicitly gave all reasons
                 disagree: explain why you disagree, propose an altenative and discuss with harmonizer
                 don't know: explain reasons why you hesitate to agree or disagree and (potentially) next steps (contact harmonizer, contact project manager, contact PI, further investigation)"
