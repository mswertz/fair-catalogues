# FAIR catalogues - a minimum information model for describing the data in multi-center studies

Purpose of this is to document the metadata necessary to describe data in collections (cohorts, registries, databanks, etc) and their mapping to data integration models (ETLs, harmonisations).
We envision that this will be used by catalogue data managers and/or software to improve quality of these descriptions and promote interability between harmonisation efforts, and the systems supporting them (e.g. catalogues)


## Modules

We partitioned MINAHCAT

* variables - for defining structure of collected datasets (e.g. cohorts) or integrated datasets (e.g. harmonized models)
* mappings - for defining how variables from a dataset are mapped in on integration model


## Background

This effort is supported by H2020 projects EUCAN-connect, with liaisons to LifeCycle, Interconnect, RECAP, CINECA, Athlete, LongITools, and Canadian Reach.
